# Close Conversation

Runs the formal **conversation-end workflow** with automatic mode and tier detection.

## Two Modes

| Mode | Detection | Purpose | Commits? |
|------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Worker Close** | `build_id` + `worker_num` in SESSION_STATE frontmatter | Package work for orchestrator review | ❌ NO |
| **Full Close** | Normal thread OR orchestrator | Complete close with finalization | ✅ YES |

## Core Principles

- Scripts handle mechanics (file lists, git status, raw content)
- LLM (Librarian) handles ALL semantic work (summaries, AARs, decisions, title)
- Title generation is semantic (3-slot emoji system: State | Type | Content)
- **Workers defer commits** to orchestrator - their job is clean handoff

---

## Step 0: Detect Mode

Check SESSION_STATE.md frontmatter for build context:
```yaml
build_id: my-project       # If present → Worker Close
worker_num: 1              # Worker number
parent_topic: My Project   # For greppable tags
```

**Detection priority:**
1. `build_id` + `worker_num` in SESSION_STATE frontmatter → Worker Close
2. `## Build Context` section in SESSION_STATE → Worker Close  
3. `mode: worker` in SESSION_STATE frontmatter → Worker Close
4. Otherwise → Full Close mode

**If Worker Close mode → Follow Worker Steps below**
**Otherwise → Follow Full Close mode**

---

# WORKER CLOSE MODE

For threads spawned by an orchestrator. Goal: **clean handoff**, not finalization.

## Worker Step 1: Verify Deliverables

Check all work products exist and are in correct locations:
- Files created? In the right paths?
- Any artifacts promised but not delivered?
- Any loose ends or caveats?

## Worker Step 2: Generate Worker Title

**Format:** `MMM DD | {State} 👷🏽‍♂️ {Content} [Parent-Topic] Task Description`

The `[Parent-Topic]` tag creates **greppable lineage** to the orchestrator.

**Example:**
```
Jan 15 | ✅ 👷🏽‍♂️ 🛠️ [CRM-Consolidation] Fix Import Paths
Jan 15 | ✅ 👷🏽‍♂️ 🏗️ [CRM-Consolidation] Build Calendar Webhook
```

The `[Parent-Topic]` comes from the orchestrator's topic slug or SESSION_STATE.

## Worker Step 3: Write Handoff Summary

Create a clear handoff package for the orchestrator to review:

```markdown
## Worker Handoff: [Task Name]

**Parent:** con_XXXXX (orchestrator)
**Status:** ✅ Complete | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ Blocked

### What Was Done
- [Specific accomplishments with file paths]

### Artifacts Created
- `file 'path/to/artifact1.py'` — [purpose]
- `file 'path/to/artifact2.md'` — [purpose]

### Caveats / Notes for Orchestrator
- [Anything the orchestrator should know]
- [Decisions made, assumptions, edge cases]

### Ready for Commit
- [ ] [List of files ready for git commit]
```

## Worker Step 4: Update SESSION_STATE

```bash
python3 N5/scripts/session_state_manager.py update --convo-id {CONVO_ID} \
  --status complete --message "Worker handoff ready for orchestrator review"
```

## Worker Step 5: Notify Orchestrator

**⚠️ PENDING IMPLEMENTATION**: The `build_worker_complete.py` script will be added during upgrade. For now, skip this step — the orchestrator will detect worker completion via SESSION_STATE status.

```bash
# python3 N5/scripts/build_worker_complete.py --convo-id {CONVO_ID} \
#   --build-id {BUILD_ID} --worker-num {WORKER_NUM}
```

This notifies the orchestrator that worker `{WORKER_NUM}` for build `{BUILD_ID}` is complete.

## Worker Step 6: DO NOT COMMIT

⚠️ **Workers do NOT git commit.** The orchestrator reviews all worker handoffs and does a single atomic commit.

**Worker close ends here.** Return control to V.

---

# FULL CLOSE MODE

For normal threads and orchestrators. Includes commits and full finalization.

## Tier Reference

| Tier | When | Cost | Time |
|------|------|------|------|
| 1 (Quick) | Default - simple discussions | ~$0.03 | <30s |
| 2 (Standard) | ≥3 artifacts, research | ~$0.06 | <90s |
| 3 (Full) | Builds, orchestrator, debug | ~$0.15 | <180s |

## Flags

- `--tier=1` / `--tier=2` / `--tier=3`: Force specific tier
- `--dry-run`: Preview without changes
- `--skip-positions`: Skip position extraction even if detected

---

## Full Step 1: Detect Tier

```bash
python3 N5/scripts/conversation_end_router.py --convo-id {CONVO_ID}
```

Review the recommendation. Override with `--tier=N` if needed.

## Full Step 2: Execute Mechanical Close

**⚠️ PENDING IMPLEMENTATION**: The tier-specific execution scripts (`conversation_end_quick.py`, `conversation_end_standard.py`, `conversation_end_full.py`) will be added during upgrade. For now, execute mechanical steps manually based on tier:

```bash
# Determine tier first
python3 N5/scripts/conversation_end_router.py --convo-id {CONVO_ID}

# Tier 1: Archive conversation workspace
# Tier 2: Gather file lists, git status
# Tier 3: Full analysis bundle including context
```

**When scripts are available:**
```bash
# Tier 1
python3 N5/scripts/conversation_end_quick.py --convo-id {CONVO_ID}

# Tier 2
python3 N5/scripts/conversation_end_standard.py --convo-id {CONVO_ID}

# Tier 3
python3 N5/scripts/conversation_end_full.py --convo-id {CONVO_ID}
```

## Full Step 3: PII Audit

**⚠️ PENDING IMPLEMENTATION**: The `conversation_pii_audit.py` script will be added during upgrade. For now, manually review files for PII before archiving.

```bash
# python3 N5/scripts/conversation_pii_audit.py --convo-id {CONVO_ID} --auto-mark
```

Skip if conversation was purely discussion with no file creation.

## Full Step 4: If Orchestrator — Review Workers

**For orchestrator threads only:**

1. List spawned workers:
   ```bash
   grep -r "parent_convo_id: {CONVO_ID}" /home/.z/workspaces/*/SESSION_STATE.md 2>/dev/null
   ```

2. For each worker, check:
   - Did it complete? (Check SESSION_STATE status)
   - Read its handoff summary
   - Verify artifacts exist

3. Generate consolidated summary:
   ```markdown
   ## Workers Summary
   - **W1 (con_XXX):** ✅ Import path fixes — 3 services updated
   - **W2 (con_YYY):** ✅ Calendar webhook — new service deployed
   - **W3 (con_ZZZ):** ⚠️ Partial — needs follow-up on X
   ```

## Full Step 5: Invoke Librarian for Semantic Close

```
set_active_persona("1bb66f53-9e2a-4152-9b18-75c2ee2c25a3")
```

### Title Generation (ALL Tiers)

**Format:** `MMM DD | {State} {Type} {Content} Semantic Title`

**3-Slot Emoji System (from `N5/config/emoji-legend.json`):**

| Slot | Purpose | Options |
|------|---------|---------|
| **State** | Thread completion | ✅ complete, ⏸️ paused, ‼️ critical, 🚧 in-progress, ❌ failed |
| **Type** | Thread structure | 📌 normal, 🐙 orchestrator, 👷🏽‍♂️ worker, 🔗 linked |
| **Content** | Work type | 🏗️ build, 🔎 research, 🛠️ repair, 🕸️ site, 🪵 log, ✍️ content, 🪞 reflection, 🤳 social, 📊 data, 💬 comms, 🗂️ organize, 📝 planning |

**Examples:**
- `Jan 15 | ✅ 📌 🏗️ CRM Query Interface Refactor`
- `Jan 15 | ✅ 🐙 🏗️ CRM Consolidation Build`
- `Jan 15 | ✅ 👷🏽‍♂️ 🛠️ [CRM-Consolidation] Fix Import Paths`

### All Tiers (Tier 1+)

1. Read SESSION_STATE.md from `/home/.z/workspaces/{CONVO_ID}/`
2. Audit: `python3 N5/scripts/session_state_manager.py audit --convo-id {CONVO_ID}`
3. **Generate title** using 3-slot emoji system + semantic description
4. Write 2-3 sentence summary (semantic, not template)
5. Verify artifacts in correct locations

### Tier 2+ Only

6. Extract key decisions WITH RATIONALE
7. Identify open items and next steps
8. Recommend file moves if needed

### Tier 3 Only (AAR Generation)

9. Read context bundle from script output
10. **WRITE the After-Action Report** (see AAR template in spec)
11. Save to `Records/AARs/{DATE}_{Slug}.md`
12. Check capability graduation: `python3 N5/scripts/capability_graduation.py check --build-slug <slug>`
13. Extract lessons worth logging

## Full Step 6: Position Detection (Conditional)

**Detect if this conversation developed worldview positions:**

Ask: Did this conversation involve:
- Deep thinking about a topic?
- V articulating a belief, stance, or position?
- New evidence/reasoning for an existing belief?
- Strategic or philosophical insights?

**If YES → Execute Position Extraction:**

```bash
python3 N5/scripts/positions.py list
python3 N5/scripts/positions.py audit
```

**For each position candidate:**

1. Check overlap: `python3 N5/scripts/positions.py check-overlap "INSIGHT_TEXT" --threshold 0.4`
2. Action based on similarity:
   - ≥0.60: EXTEND existing position
   - 0.50-0.59: Review carefully
   - <0.50: CREATE new position
3. Create or extend accordingly

**If NO positions detected → Skip.**

## Full Step 7: Commit Target Suggestions

Load registry: `cat N5/config/commit_targets.json`

Present options (do NOT auto-commit):

```markdown
## Commit Opportunities

☐ **Learning Profile** — [Concepts learned, if any]
☐ **Content Library** — [Articles saved, if any]
☐ **Voice Library** — [Distinctive phrases, if any]
☐ **Positions** — [Worldview claims extracted, if any]
☐ **Git** — [Code changes, if any]

Reply with which items to commit, or skip to close.
```

## Full Step 8: Execute Commits

Based on V's selection, execute the relevant commits.

For orchestrators with workers, this is the **atomic commit point** - all worker changes committed together.

## Full Step 9: Return to Operator

```
set_active_persona("90a7486f-46f9-41c9-a98c-21931fa5c5f6")
```

Present formatted close output. End with:

```
✅ Conversation closed (Tier N)
```

## Anti-Patterns

❌ **Script-based title generation** — Title is semantic (LLM), not pattern matching
❌ **Regex decision extraction** — Produces garbage
❌ **Template-filled AARs** — Produces hollow documents
❌ **Claiming "Done" without reading** — Must understand before writing
❌ **Workers committing directly** — Defers to orchestrator for atomic commit
