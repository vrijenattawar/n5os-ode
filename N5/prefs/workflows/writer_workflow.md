# Writer Workflow

## Overview

Authentic voice writing methodology. Effective writing is direct, concise, precise, authentic, and clear. Load this file for any substantive writing task.

---

## Phase 1: Audience & Format Clarification (REQUIRED START)

**Before writing anything, clarify:**

1. **Who is reading this?** (Decision-maker, technical team, public, specific person)
2. **What action should they take after reading?** (Decide, understand, respond, share)
3. **What format?** (Email, doc, social post, meeting notes)
4. **What's the context they already have?** (Avoid redundant setup)
5. **What's the one thing they must remember?** (Core message)

If any are unclear, ask before proceeding.

## Voice Principles

| Principle | Meaning | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Direct** | No preamble, get to point | ❌ "I wanted to reach out to..." ✅ "Quick question:" |
| **Concise** | Every word earns its place | ❌ "In order to" ✅ "To" |
| **Precise** | Specific over vague | ❌ "soon" ✅ "by Friday" |
| **Authentic** | Human, not corporate | ❌ "Please advise" ✅ "What do you think?" |
| **Clear** | Simple language | ❌ "leverage synergies" ✅ "work together" |

---

## Sentence & Word Standards

### Sentence Structure
- **Length**: 10-20 words average
- **Voice**: Active (not passive)
- **Clauses**: Minimal (one main idea per sentence)
- **Structure**: Subject → Verb → Object

**Test**: Read aloud. If you run out of breath, split it.

### Word Choice
| Prefer | Avoid |
|--------|-------|
| Concrete nouns | Abstract nouns |
| Strong verbs | Weak verbs + adverbs |
| Specific numbers | Vague quantities |
| Plain English | Jargon (unless defined) |

**Kill list**: very, really, quite, just, actually, basically, literally, honestly

## Content Type Templates

### Email
```
Subject: [Full summary - reader knows the ask from subject line]

[1-2 sentence context if needed]

[The ask or key information - bold if multiple paragraphs]

[Specific next step with owner and deadline]
```

**Email rules:**
- Subject line = complete summary (reader can act without opening)
- Body ≤5 sentences for routine asks
- One ask per email
- Deadline explicit ("by EOD Friday" not "soon")

### Meeting Notes
```
## [Meeting Name] - [Date]
**Attendees**: [Names]

### Context
[1-2 sentences: why this meeting happened]

### Key Points
- [Bullet: specific point]
- [Bullet: specific point]

### Decisions
- [Decision]: [Owner] will [action] by [date]

### Action Items
- [ ] [Owner]: [Specific action] by [date]
- [ ] [Owner]: [Specific action] by [date]

### Open Questions
- [Question]: [Who will resolve] by [when]
```

### Documentation
```
## [Title]

### Purpose
[One sentence: what this does and why it exists]

### Usage
[Step-by-step: how to use it]

### Examples
[Concrete examples from real use cases]

### Edge Cases
[What happens when X, Y, Z]

### Troubleshooting
[Common issues and fixes]
```

### Social Posts (LinkedIn)
- **Hook**: First line earns the click (pattern interrupt or bold claim)
- **Body**: 3-5 short paragraphs, each a complete thought
- **Takeaway**: One actionable insight
- **Length**: 800-1200 characters optimal
- **Format**: White space between paragraphs, no walls of text

### Product Copy
- **Lead with benefit**, not feature
- **One value prop per section**
- **No buzzwords** (innovative, cutting-edge, world-class → delete)
- **Specific proof** (numbers, testimonials, examples)

## Anti-Patterns & Fixes

| Anti-Pattern | Symptom | Fix |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| **Corporate speak** | "Leverage synergies", "circle back" | Plain language: "use", "follow up" |
| **Fluff/throat-clearing** | "It is important to note that..." | Cut directly to point |
| **Hedge words** | "Very important", "really good" | Remove intensifiers or use metrics |
| **Passive voice** | "The decision was made by the team" | "The team decided" |
| **Unclear action** | "We should think about improving X" | "[Owner] will prototype X by [date]" |
| **Wall of text** | No paragraph breaks | Max 3 sentences per paragraph |
| **Buried lede** | Key point in paragraph 4 | Key point in sentence 1 |

---

## Quality Standards

Before delivering, verify:

| Standard | Test |
|----------|------|
| **Scannable** | Can reader grasp key points in 30 seconds? |
| **Actionable** | Is next step clear? |
| **Concise** | Can any sentence be cut without losing meaning? |
| **Authentic** | Does it sound like a human, not corporate speak? |
| **Complete** | Are all questions answered? Citations included? |

---

## Phase 2: Draft

1. **Outline first** — Structure before prose
2. **Dump then cut** — Write freely, then ruthlessly edit
3. **Lead with the point** — First sentence = main message
4. **One idea per paragraph** — Each paragraph has one job
5. **End with action** — What should reader do next?

---

## Phase 3: Edit (Mandatory)

### Pass 1: Structure
- [ ] Does first sentence convey the main point?
- [ ] Is there a clear through-line?
- [ ] Can anything be cut entirely?

### Pass 2: Sentences
- [ ] Active voice throughout?
- [ ] Sentences under 20 words average?
- [ ] No hedge words (very, really, quite)?

### Pass 3: Words
- [ ] Concrete nouns, strong verbs?
- [ ] No corporate speak?
- [ ] Jargon defined or eliminated?

### Pass 4: Final
- [ ] Read aloud — does it flow?
- [ ] Audience gets one takeaway clearly?
- [ ] Action is explicit?
