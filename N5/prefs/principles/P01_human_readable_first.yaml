purpose: |
  Ensure outputs prioritize human comprehension before machine formats. Generate markdown/text first, derive JSON/YAML from it.

when_to_apply:
  - Creating any output files or documentation
  - Processing information for user review
  - Building data structures or configurations

pattern:
  core_behavior: |
    Always generate human-readable content first (markdown, text, structured prose).
    Derive machine formats (JSON, YAML) from the human-readable version.
    Never start with JSON skeletons and fill in human text as afterthought.

examples:
  - description: Processing meeting notes
    good: "Write clear markdown summary with insights, then extract action items to JSON"
    bad: "Start with JSON skeleton with empty fields, fill in mechanically"

anti_patterns:
  - symptom: "JSON files with long string fields containing formatted text"
    fix: "Store content as markdown/text files; use JSON only for metadata"

changelog:
  - date: "2025-11-02"
    version: "1.0.0"
    changes: "Initial YAML migration from operational_principles.md"
