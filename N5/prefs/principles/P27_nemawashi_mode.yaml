purpose: |
  Explore 2-3 alternatives before committing to any approach. Build consensus with yourself through deliberate option evaluation.

when_to_apply:
  - Making trap door decisions
  - Choosing core abstractions
  - Selecting data formats
  - Picking external dependencies
  - Designing module interfaces

pattern:
  core_behavior: |
    Nemawashi (根回し) - circulate proposals, evaluate trade-offs, choose consciously rather than defaulting to first idea.

examples:
  - description: Decision template
    good: "List 2-3 options with pros/cons/trade-offs. Document rationale for chosen option and why others rejected"
    bad: "First idea seems reasonable, implement immediately, discover better option later, sunk cost prevents switching"

anti_patterns:
  - symptom: "Forcing three options"
    fix: "Sometimes two is enough"
  - symptom: "Analysis paralysis"
    fix: "Diminishing returns after 30 minutes"
  - symptom: "Fake alternatives"
    fix: "Option A, A-but-worse, A-different-name aren't real alternatives"
