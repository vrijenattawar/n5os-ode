purpose: |
  Choose simple (few intertwined concepts) over easy (familiar, convenient). Simple systems are maintainable. Easy systems become complex.

when_to_apply:
  - Choosing data storage
  - Selecting libraries/frameworks
  - Designing abstractions
  - Evaluating alternatives

pattern:
  core_behavior: |
    Simple = few braided concepts (objective, count them). Easy = familiar, near at hand (subjective). Choose simple even when less convenient.

examples:
  - description: Data storage choice
    good: "Direct SQL + JSON: 3 independent concepts (connection, SQL, JSON). More explicit"
    bad: "ORM framework: 7+ intertwined concepts (connection, schema, query generation, type coercion, transactions, caching, relationships)"

anti_patterns:
  - symptom: "'This framework does everything'"
    fix: "Easy, not simple. Count the braids"
  - symptom: "'It's just one line'"
    fix: "Line count ≠ simplicity. Count concepts instead"
