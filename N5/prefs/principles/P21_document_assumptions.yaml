name: Document All Assumptions, Placeholders, and Stubs
category: quality
priority: high
version: "1.0.0"
created: "2025-11-02"

purpose: |
  Make temporary/incomplete implementations explicit and trackable. Never silently leave placeholder code without documentation.

when_to_apply:
  - System implementations with placeholder logic
  - Scripts with stub functions
  - Designs with assumptions about future work
  - Any code with TODO or FIXME comments
  - Handoff documentation

pattern:
  core_behavior: |
    Track EVERY assumption made during implementation.
    Document ALL placeholders (TODO, FIXME, placeholder for...).
    List ALL stubs, simulations, or mock implementations.
    Create a manifest of what is incomplete.

examples:
  - description: Placeholder function documentation
    good: 'STUB comment: Returns empty list. Needs actual LLM extraction. Location line 45'
    bad: 'TODO: implement later with no tracking'
  - description: Assumptions manifest
    good: 'ASSUMPTIONS.md with Assumptions made, Placeholders list, Stubs and simulations'
    bad: 'Scattered TODO comments with no central tracking'
  - description: API assumption
    good: 'ASSUMPTION comment: API supports pagination (VERIFY with docs)'
    bad: 'Assume API works a certain way without noting it'

anti_patterns:
  - symptom: 'Writing placeholder code and forgetting it exists'
    fix: 'Create ASSUMPTIONS.md listing all placeholders with status and priority'
  - symptom: 'Assuming someone will figure it out later'
    fix: 'Document exactly what needs to be figured out and where'
  - symptom: 'Leaving TODO comments without tracking them centrally'
    fix: 'Maintain manifest of all TODOs with context and effort estimates'
  - symptom: 'Treating placeholders as if they are real implementations'
    fix: 'Add explicit guards like assert not IS_PRODUCTION or data_source equals real_api'
