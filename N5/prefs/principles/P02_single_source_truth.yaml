version: "1.0.0"
created: "2025-11-02"

purpose: |
  Maintain exactly one canonical location for each piece of information to prevent drift and inconsistency.

when_to_apply:
  - Storing factual information or specifications
  - Creating reference documentation
  - Managing configuration or settings

pattern:
  core_behavior: |
    Each fact lives in exactly one canonical location.
    All other references link to the canonical source rather than duplicating content.
    Update only the single source; never sync duplicates manually.

examples:
  - description: Project requirements
    good: "Single requirements.md file; other docs link to specific sections"
    bad: "Requirements copied into multiple docs, creating sync nightmare"

anti_patterns:
  - symptom: "Same information appears verbatim in multiple files"
    fix: "Choose canonical location, replace other instances with links"

changelog:
  - date: "2025-11-02"
    version: "1.0.0"
    changes: "Initial YAML migration from operational_principles.md"
