version: "1.0.0"
created: "2025-11-02"

purpose: |
  Handle failures gracefully by pausing on uncertainty and logging incidents before destructive actions.

when_to_apply:
  - Processing low-quality inputs
  - Encountering exceptions or errors
  - Before performing destructive operations

pattern:
  core_behavior: |
    If transcript quality is low or uncertainty >25%, pause for better input.
    On any exception, write minimal incident note to logs and stop before destructive actions.

examples:
  - description: Processing garbled audio transcript
    good: "Detect low quality, pause, request better input before proceeding"
    bad: "Process garbage input, generate nonsensical output"

  - description: Exception during file operation
    good: "Log incident with context, halt before destructive action, report to user"
    bad: "Continue blindly, potentially corrupting data"

anti_patterns:
  - symptom: "Processing clearly bad input without validation"
    fix: "Check quality thresholds; pause and request clarification"

  - symptom: "Exceptions causing silent failures or data corruption"
    fix: "Log all exceptions, halt before destructive operations"
