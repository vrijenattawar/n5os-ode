name: Complete Before Claiming Complete
category: quality
priority: critical
version: "1.0.0"
created: "2025-11-02"

purpose: |
  Report accurate progress, never claim completion prematurely. Only mark tasks complete when all requirements are met and verified.

when_to_apply:
  - Multi-phase projects
  - Automation workflows
  - System migrations
  - Integration work
  - Any task with multiple deliverables

pattern:
  core_behavior: |
    Track progress explicitly with quantitative metrics (e.g., "13/23 complete, 56%").
    Test all success criteria before marking complete.
    If blocked or uncertain, state what remains rather than claiming done.

examples:
  - description: Reporting progress on migration
    good: 'Completed 13/23 files (56%). Remaining: validation scripts, documentation, integration tests'
    bad: 'Done reported when only 59% complete'
  - description: Multi-phase automation
    good: 'Phase 1/3 complete (33%). Report generation done, Execution TODO, Validation TODO'
    bad: 'Automation complete when only planning phase works'

anti_patterns:
  - symptom: 'Claiming done while significant work remains'
    fix: 'Use quantitative progress metrics and explicit remaining work lists'
  - symptom: 'Ambiguous status updates like mostly done or almost there'
    fix: 'State exact completion percentage and what is left'
  - symptom: 'Premature completion claims due to loss of context'
    fix: 'Review all original requirements before claiming complete'
